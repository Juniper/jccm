## Installation

1. Download the appropriate installer for your system from the GitHub releases page:
   - For Intel-based macOS: [Download jccm-darwin-x64.dmg](../../raw/main/installers/jccm-darwin-x64.dmg)
   - For ARM-based macOS: [Download jccm-darwin-arm64.dmg](../../raw/main/installers/jccm-darwin-arm64.dmg)
   - For Intel-based Windows: [Download jccm-windows-x64-setup.exe](../../raw/main/installers/jccm-windows-x64-setup.exe)

2. Install the application:
   - Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file.
   - Drag and drop the JCCM application to the `Applications` folder.

3. Resolve macOS Gatekeeper issue:
   - macOS Gatekeeper might prevent the application from running, showing an error that the app is "damaged and canâ€™t be opened." This happens because the app is from an unidentified developer.
   - To fix this, open the terminal and run the following command to remove the quarantine attribute:
     ```bash
     xattr -cr /Applications/Juniper\ Cloud\ Connection\ Manager.app
     ```

4. Run the JCCM application from the `Applications` folder.

## Inventory Excel File Format

To ensure proper inventory management, the Excel file must include the following mandatory fields in the headers:

- **organization**: Name of the organization
- **site**: Site location of the device
- **address**: Address of the site
- **port**: Port number for the SSH server in the device
- **username**: Username for device access
- **password**: Password for device access

Here is an example of how the device inventory file should be formatted:

```plaintext
| organization | site        | address         | port | username | password  |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------|----------|-----------|
| Org1         | Site1       | 192.168.1.1     | 22   | admin    | password1 |
| Org2         | Site2       | 10.0.0.2        | 22   | user     | password2 |
| Org3         | Headquarters| 172.16.0.1      | 22   | root     | rootpass  |
```
